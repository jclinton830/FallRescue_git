# FallRescue

FallRescue is real time fall detection system developed with C++ programming language in visual studio 2013. This real time software, tracks human body motion with the use of depth sensing camera. The software is able to track 25 joints of a detected human being in the 3D space, and join them together to form a skeleton. An algorithm does all the heavy lifting to use this skeletal data to detect an actual fall from other activities. Once an actual falling activity is detected the software awaits to see if the victim moves after the incident, if there is no movement sensed from the victim in four seconds, then it is determined that the activity was a fall. The process model of FallRescue, and its algorithm is shown below respectively.

This software framework, collects and curates data for further evaluation. Additionaly, it provides visualisation of the skeletal data during debugging or installation process to make sure everything works. The sekeletal data is visualised for as shown below, captured during an installation session.

# Application

This software along with its hardware can be used to help make people of old age live safe. Most old people live alone, and according to past surveys falls are a major death toll riser in ages above 60. For someone of such age who is living alone, during a catestrophic fall, this software will become very helpful to bring help to the location of the fall without any delay.
